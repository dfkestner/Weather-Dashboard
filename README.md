# Weather Dashboard
Allows users to search for current and upcoming weather conditions in multiple cities. In the future, I'd like to develop the Dashboard further to improve the styling, especially for users who do not have recent searches to pull from local storage. I'd also like to adjust the items that render/don't render for Recent Cities, and allow the user to click on recent searches to populate data from each city.
